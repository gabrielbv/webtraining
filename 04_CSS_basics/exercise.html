Adding the link

Great! Now we want to add a link with text to our button.

In our example back in the first exercise, you may have noticed that we used <span></span> tags to create a different font color for "Facebook!", like so:

<a>Friend us on <span>Facebook!</span></a>

You can do this too, if you like, but it's not required.
Instructions

On the HTML tab:

Add a link (using <a></a> tags) between your <div></div> tags. You can set its href attribute to go to any website, and you can make the link text itself say whatever you want!

On the CSS tab:

Set your link's text-decoration to "none". Give it whatever color or font type you like!
