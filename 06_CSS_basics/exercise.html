Headings, paragraphs, and lists

Finally, let's add the content of our resume: headers to describe experience, skills, and education, paragraphs to add details, and lists to... well, make lists!
Instructions

Include any combination of headers (any kind: h1 through h6), paragraphs, and lists (ordered or unordered) you'd like. Just be sure to include at least one header, one paragraph, and one list.
