<!-- 
Laying out your divs

First, you'll want to create four <div>s: one for the header, one for the left column, one for the right column, and one for the footer.
Instructions

On the HTML tab, create four <div>s: one with an ID of "header", one with a class of "left", one with a class of "right", and one with an ID of "footer".

On the CSS tab, give all your divs whatever styling you like! We recommend giving them all a border-radius of 5px for that rounded corner look.
