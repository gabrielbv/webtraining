Sizing and color

Good! Now let's add dimensions and color to our <div>s so we can see them.

You can give the sections of your resume any sizing or color you likeâ€”feel free to look back at the first exercise in this project to see what sizing we used.
Instructions

Give your <div>s a height, width, and background color!
