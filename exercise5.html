<!-- Link me!

Great! There's only one problem: your webpage is like a house with no doors. There's no way to get in or out! We'll fix that by adding a couple of links.

Once you successfully add your links and hit Run, you've finished! Revel in the glory of your newly created webpage.

If it still looks a little basic to you, don't worry. We'll soon teach you CSS to make your webpages look sharp!
Instructions

Add at least two links to your webpage. You can turn an image or a bit of text into a link; you can even turn part of the text inside your <p> tags into a link!

Check out the Hint if you've forgotten how the <a> tag works.
