/*User Choice

We start by first asking the user which option they want to pick. We will later use this choice in the compare function to determine the winner.
Instructions

    Declare a variable called userChoice.
    Make the variable equal to the answer we get by asking the user "Do you choose rock, paper or scissors?"
