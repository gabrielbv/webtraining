/*Confirm

You have some programming skills. Time to make something you can show people! We're going to show you how to program a 'choose your own adventure' game. It'll have a basic story line, have the user make some choices, and have a happy ending. Then you can modify it as you wish and show off your creative talents!
Instructions

    It's always polite to ask your user if they are ready to play.
    Using the confirm command, make sure your user is ready to play. For example, I would use the sentence "I am ready to play!". Add whatever phrase you would like in the confirm.

// Check if the user is ready to play!
confirm("I am ready to play!")
