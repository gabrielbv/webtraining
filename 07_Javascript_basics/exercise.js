/*Adding some story

You have to set the scene for your story. I've written up a short little introduction you can use for now. Under all your previous code, print out the following introduction:

Snow White and Batman were hanging out at the bus stop, waiting to go to the shops. There was a sale on and both needed some new threads. You've never really liked Batman. You walk up to him.
Instructions

    Print the introduction using console.log
    The introduction is full of words. Words are called 'strings' in JavaScript. Don't forget how to properly use strings!

    console.log("You're allowed to play but we are not responsible for you")
}

    console.log("Great! let's play")

console.log("Snow White and Batman were hanging out at the bus stop, waiting to go to 
	the shops. There was a sale on and both needed some new threads. You've never really
