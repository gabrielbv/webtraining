First move!

So your story is really moving along! There is a scene. Your user is about to talk to Batman. You want to see if your user is ready to smackdown with Batman.
Instructions

    Under your existing code, print out the storyline: "Batman glares at you."
    Then declare a variable userAnswer. Make it equal a prompt that asks the user "Are you feeling lucky, punk?". This will be the question that Batman asks your user.
