Drop Shadow Like It's Hot

Time to drop a little CSS3 magic on this bad boy. CSS3 is just the most recent CSS standardâ€”it's not any different from what you've been learning, but it includes some cool new features like box-shadow.

The box-shadow property can take a comma-separated list of shadows, each defined by 2 - 4 length values (which specify the horizontal offset, vertical offset, optional blur distance and optional spread distance of the shadow), an optional color value, and an optional "inset" keyword that makes an inner shadow instead of the default outer shadow.

We used

box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px #888;

in our examples in the first exercise, but feel free to play around!
Instructions

Give your button a box-shadow with whatever values you like.
