<!-- Set the Size

Good! Unfortunately, we can't see the fruits of our labor yet because our <div> doesn't have a size or a border.

Let's remedy the first problem. On the stylesheet.css tab, give your <div> a height and a width. You can make it any size you like!

 <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Buttons Galore!</title>
        <link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='stylesheet.css'/>
	</head>
	<body>
     <div></div>   
	</body>
