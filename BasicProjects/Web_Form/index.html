Radio Buttons

Perfect! You can already see your form coming together: with two <input> fields and a <textarea>, we could easily imagine a setup where users could post comments with their first name, last name, and the text of their message.

Speaking of <input>s, another handy type is the radio button, which is that round button you might see on websites that ask for you to select a single input from several choices, such as "yes" or "no," your sex, or your year in college. Radio buttons are <input> tags of type='radio'.

To add a label to your radio buttons, you can simply add the text after the <input> tag, like so:

<input type='radio'>Yes
<input type='radio'>No

Instructions

Between your <form></form> tags, add two radio buttons. You don't need to give them name or value attributes, but you certainly can if you'd like to practice. Go ahead and give them whatever labels you like!
