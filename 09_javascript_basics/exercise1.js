Declare your variables

First, we'll start by declaring the variables we'll be using: text, myName, and hits.

Since text could be quite long, try putting a backslash (\) at the end of each line to make your string "wrap" to the next line of the editor. That way you avoid really long lines! (Feel free to peek back at the first exercise for an example.)

You can ignore the /*jshint... line for now. All that does is tell the console to stop worrying about our use of backslash characters for wrapping long lines of text.
Instructions

Declare and set the following three variables:

    text, and make it a string containing some text. Place your name in there a couple of times!
    myName, and make it a string containing just your name.
    hits, and make it an empty array.

var myName="Gabi"
