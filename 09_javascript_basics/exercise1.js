/*

Your first "for" loop

Awesome! Now let's write our outer for loop.
Instructions

Below your existing code, create a for loop that starts at 0, continues until it reaches the end of text, and increments by 1 each time. (This means it will check each character in the string.) There's no need to write anything between the {}s of your loop just yet.

Check the Hint if you need help!
