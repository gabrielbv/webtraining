<!-- Remember: it's better with a header

You'll want to give your table a header so everyone will know what your photos are of and about.

To make sure your header looks nice, remember to set its colspan attribute to 3 (since you have three columns and you want the header to go across all of them).
Instructions

Create a table header using <thead></thead> and <th></th> tags. Feel free to call your table whatever you'd like!
