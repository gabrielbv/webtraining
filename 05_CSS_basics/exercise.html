Style those divs!

Good! Now let's give our divs a basic look. (We'll use classes in a minute to change the appearance of our divs depending on whether a given person is a friend, family member, or nefarious nemesis.)

We've started the div selector for you with a little positioning magic (display: inline-block and margin-left: 5px). We'll explain these in the next lesson!

Please note: If you have adjusted your browser's zoom, tests involving height and width will not work correctly. To remedy this, please type Command+0 or Ctrl+0 to reset your view.
Instructions

In the meantime, give your divs a makeover on the CSS tab:

    Give them a height and width of 100 pixels.
    Set their border-radius to 100%. (Can you guess what this does before you look?)
    Give them a border that's two pixels wide, solid, and black.
