Use classes to add class

Good work! Now that we've added classes to our HTML document, we can add a little style to them.
Instructions

    Give members of your "friend" class a border that's 2px dashed #008000.
    Give members of your "family" class a border that's 2px dashed #0000FF.
    Give members of your "enemy" class a border that's 2px dashed #FF0000.
