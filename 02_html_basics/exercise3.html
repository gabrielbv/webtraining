<!-- A bit about you

Great! Now we know your name and what you look like, but that's about it. Your profile page should include a little bit about you! (After all, that's the point of a profile in the first place.)
Instructions

Create a paragraph below your picture that mentions your age, gender, and hometown. Don't get too carried awayâ€”we'll get to your interests, favorite things, and where you've lived, worked, or gone to school in the next section!
