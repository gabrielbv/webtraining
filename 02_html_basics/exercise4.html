<!-- Profile sections

Nice! It's starting to look like a profile page already.

Most profile pages are divided up into sections: your interests, favorite quotes, where you work, where you went to school, where you live, and so on. We can do this with an unordered list!

Below the paragraph about yourself, create an unordered list. Each list item should be a category: for example, Interests, Jobs, Favorite Quotes, Where I've Lived, and so on.
