<!-- Every house needs a frame

An HTML page is sort of like a house: it needs a certain number of essential structures in order to work. Just like a house, an HTML page needs a frame. In this case, your frame is made of <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
Instructions

Your webpage is blank as the day it was born! Let's add five things:

    The <!DOCTYPE> tag
    Your <html> tags
    Your <head> tags
    <title> tags (with any title you like!) between your head tags
    Your <body> tags

 -->
 <!DOCTYPE>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
    </head>
    <body>
        
    </body>
</html>
