<!-- A picture's worth a thousand words

Nice work! Your page is still looking a bit spare, though. Better add an image or two to spruce things up a bit.

Remember, to insert an image from the web you will need to right-click and select "Copy image URL." Then use this URL in your <img> tag.
Instructions

Insert an <img> tag between your <body> tags. Feel free to put it anywhere! (We think it'd look best after your <h1> tag, but before your <p> tags.) You can make the src attribute point to any image you like.
